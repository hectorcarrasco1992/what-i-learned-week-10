# Return of CSS

    This week we returned to my arch-nemesis CSS. This time it was a bit more complicated in that we had to learn new tools to make our CSS better.

## Instabox

* We were tasked with re-creating the instagram page.
*  This project helped us work on our collaborating skills.
*  We were to use gitpull in order to work on the updates our partners already added.
*  Flex-boxes were used heavily

## Copy-Ocelot
* Similar to Insatbox except with a more complex webpage to copy.
* The page i chose was GrubHub
